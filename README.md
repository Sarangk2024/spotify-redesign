# Spotify Web Player Redesign

A modern and minimalist redesign of the Spotify web player interface, focusing on a clean aesthetic, intuitive navigation, and a dark theme. This project serves as a demonstration of front-end development skills using modern web technologies.

## Features

-   **Modern UI:** A sleek, dark-themed interface with rounded corners and a spacious layout.
-   **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
-   **Clean Navigation:** A simple sidebar for easy access to main sections like Home, Search, and Library.
-   **Component-Based Structure:** Content is organized into reusable card components for albums, artists, and playlists.
-   **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects on cards and buttons to provide visual feedback.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** The core structure of the web page.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for all styling and responsive design. This allows for rapid development without writing custom CSS.

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the entire HTML code into a new text file.
2.  **Name the File:** Save the file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `spotify_redesign.html`).
3.  **Open in Browser:** Open the file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to view the live website. No web server is required.
